<h2>WP-PlaceSpeak-Connect</h2>
<p><strong>Version: 1.0.0</strong></p>
<p>This plugin allows organizations with PlaceSpeak Connect apps on Placespeak.com to use geoverification tools in their Wordpress installation.</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Admin can add apps using app key, app secret, and a standard redirect_uri</li>
    <li>"Connect With PlaceSpeak" button available as shortcode or as part of a commenting form</li>
    <li>Commenters that authorize PlaceSpeak will also have verification information, names, and region labels relative to app saved as meta information with comment</li>
    <li>Allows admin to store user information in WP_USERS table or custom placespeak_user table</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bugs and fixes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Do we need shortcode? Having it means that wp-placespeak-connect scripts and styles are loaded on every page (just in case they use it)</li>
    <li>Need to change dev.placespeak.com to placespeak.com</li>
</ul>
<h4>Coming Soon</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Single Sign On with PlaceSpeak account into Wordpress</li>
    <li>App creation from Wordpress (instead of going to PlaceSpeak to create them)</li>
</ul>
